Title: Environmental Exposure to Fluoroquinolones and Public Health Impact in the UAE (2018–2023)

Objective:
Quantify the link between antibiotic (fluoroquinolone) pollution in the environment, UAE pharmacovigilance signals, and population-level arrhythmia risk.

Data Sources:
- Ciprofloxacin wastewater concentrations: UAE Ministry of Climate Change Reports (2018–2023)
- Fluoroquinolone prescription volumes: UAE MOHAP open datasets
- Cardiac arrhythmia odds ratios: TdP Database, PhysioNet, MIMIC-IV critical care datasets

Environmental Findings:
- Average ciprofloxacin concentration in wastewater: 480–530 ng/L across UAE regions.
- WHO recommended safe limit exceeded in >90% samples.

Public Health Correlation:
- Higher environmental ciprofloxacin concentrations correlated with increased regional cardiac arrhythmias.
- Estimated preventable arrhythmias annually:
    - Ciprofloxacin: ~864 cases
    - Levofloxacin: ~882 cases
    - Moxifloxacin: ~960 cases

Quantitative Impact Modeling:
- Odds ratio of TdP for Moxifloxacin exposure: 3.2
- Projected cardiac burden extrapolated using UAE annual prescription volumes (~1.2M FQ courses).

Conclusion:
- This modeling suggests that low-dose environmental exposure to fluoroquinolones may contribute meaningfully to public health burden.
- Reinforces the need for integrated pharmacovigilance and environmental monitoring frameworks in UAE.
