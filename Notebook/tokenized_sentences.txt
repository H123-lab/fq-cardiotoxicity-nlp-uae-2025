pharmaceutical products reported within our pharmacovigilance system during the past year suspected adverse drug reactions are reported to doh pharmacovigilance program by healthcare professionalsfacilities adrs database is examined and investigated regularly by doh pharmacovigilance team as part of routine safety monitoring to ensure that medical products used in abu dhabi are safe and effective we recognize the invaluable contributions of healthcare professionals and other stakeholders in reporting adverse drug events which are instrumental in enhancing drug safety surveillance and promoting public health together we remain committed to advancing the science of pharmacovigilance fostering proactive risk management and safeguarding the wellbeing of patients worldwide data collation and analyses the data used for analysis was for the period between january and december 2023 it follows the previous report of adr data analysis for the years 20132022 adverse reactions following immunizations reports are not included in this analysisinformation to be used in this analysis was extracted in microsoft excel files from doh electronic reporting system from the reports and collated on patients demographic information such as age gender hospitalization status outcome of the adverse event seriousness of the adverse event profession of the reporter type of products involved organ system affected were collated adverse drug reaction for marketed drugs in abu dhabi in this report were categorized using meddra terminology a single standardized international medical terminology which can be used for regulatory communication and evaluation of data pertaining to medicinal products for human use involving different systemorgan classes soc with the relevant preferred term number of reports and mode of reporting a total of 1522 adverse drug reaction reports were submitted to the pharmacovigilance program during the period of january december 2023 this years count is 235 higher than the average annual reports received for the past 10 years 645 all reports were received through the enotification system data revealed that the proportion of reports from the private sector was higher than those from public sectors 79 21 respectively this shows an increase in the private sector reporting compared to previous years adverse drug reactions received by drug classification the total number of suspected drugs reported was 1667 drug 1091 generic name and 576 other generic names none from brand name as the generic and other generic names were not ever blank at any of the reportssome adr reports had more than one suspected drug reported which explains why the number of drugs is more than the number of reports 1667 vs 1522 respectively antibacterial antibiotics count is 566 represent the highest therapeutic category associated with adr incidences with percentage of 34 this is consistent with the previous years results which showed that antibiotics were the highest therapeutic category of drugs associated with adr events it is followed by therapeutic nutrientsmineralselectrolytes count is 293 and percentage is 176 followed by antiinflammatory agents count is 225 percentage of 135 and cardiovascular distribution of reported drug therapeutic of 126 suspected drugs in adr reports ferric carboxy maltose was the most reported drug suspected to be associated with an adverse drug reaction by 257 reports resembling for 154 of the total reported suspected drugs during 2023 ceftriaxone comes next with 174 reports 104 followed

case outcome and seriousness of the adverse events in 1337 8784 of the submitted reports patients had recovered from the adverse drug reaction symptoms 156 patients 1025 were still recovering at the time of report submission 14 patients 092 recovered with sequelae while 8 053 patients had an unknown outcome only 7 patients 045 showed no recovery for the adverse drug reactions most of the submitted reports were nonserious 1469 965 healthcare professionals and providers are required to report all adrs whether serious or nonserious as per doh standard aiming to capture all adverse known and unknown drug reactions the 53 serious adverse reactions reported resembling around 35 of the total reports were then included in a further analysis to provide close insights into the type of seriousness for those 53 reports categories and reports count of seriousness type are shown in the below graph those which required hospitalization were the most reported in 20 cases this was followed by required intervention to prevent permanent harmimpairmentdamage reported in 9 cases life threatening were also reported in 9 cases other seriousness as well as prolonged hospitalization more than 24 hours were reported in 7 cases while just serious was reported in 1 case reporting facilities a total of 89 different healthcare facilities including different healthcare facility branches had

fluoroquinolones are divided into 2 groups based on antimicrobial spectrum and pharmacology older group ciprofloxacin norfloxacin and ofloxacin newer group delafloxacin gemifloxacin levofloxacin and moxifloxacin many newer fluoroquinolones have been withdrawn from the united states market because of toxicity when given systemically they include trovafloxacin because of severe hepatic toxicity gatifloxacin because of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia it is still available in the united states as an ophthalmic preparation grepafloxacin because of cardiac toxicity temafloxacin because of acute renal failure hepatotoxicity hemolytic anemia coagulopathy and hypoglycemia and lomefloxacin sparfloxacin and enoxacin contraindications include previous allergic reaction to the medications certain disorders that predispose to arrhythmias eg qtinterval prolongation uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia significant bradycardia use of medications known to prolong the qt interval or to cause bradycardia eg metoclopramide cisapride erythromycin clarithromycin classes ia and iii antiarrhythmics tricyclic antidepressants delafloxacin does not appear to cause significant prolongation of the qt interval adverse effects of fluoroquinolones fluoroquinolones have boxed warnings because they have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that have occurred together including hypoglycemia can occur especially when a fluoroquinolone is combined with antihyperglycemic medications qtinterval prolongation can occur potentially leading to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death aortic aneurysm and dissection can occur with a potentially increased risk in patients who have risk factors for aortic aneurysm eg marfan syndrome or who have a known aortic aneurysmhypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions may occur after the first dose or subsequent doses fluoroquinolone use should be stopped at the first sign of rash jaundice sign of hypersensitivity and photosensitivity can occur resulting in exaggerated sunburn reactions patients taking fluoroquinolones should avoid excessive ultraviolet exposure dosing considerations for fluoroquinolones dose reduction except for moxifloxacin is required for patients with renal insufficiency older fluoroquinolones are normally given twice a day newer ones and an extendedrelease form of ciprofloxacin are given once a day ciprofloxacin raises theophylline levels sometimes resulting in theophyllinerelated adverse effects sentiment analysis on risk awareness in
